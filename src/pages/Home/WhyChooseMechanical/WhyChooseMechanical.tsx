                            <span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Tactile Feedback:</span> Mechanical keyboards provide a distinct tactile feedback with each keystroke, allowing for a more satisfying typing experience. This feedback can enhance typing accuracy and speed, making them a preferred choice for long typing sessions.
                        </p>

                            <span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Durability:</span> Built to last, mechanical keyboards feature individual mechanical switches that are rated for millions of key presses. Unlike traditional rubber dome keyboards, which wear out quickly, mechanical keyboards maintain their performance over time.

Whether you prefer a clicky, tactile feel or a smooth, quiet keystroke, thereâ€™s a switch to suit your typing style.
